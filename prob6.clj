;; The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 12 + 22
;; + ... + 102 = 385

;; The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, (1 + 2 +
;; ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025

;; Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first
;; ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

;; Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
;; hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
